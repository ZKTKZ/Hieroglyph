    <h1><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h1>

    <p class="underline">Q: How does Hieroglyph work?</p>
    <p>Youtube automatically transcribes most videos. We grab the transcriptions off of Youtube, format it, and give you a readable version.</p>

    <p class="underline">Q: I am getting a 'No transcript available' error. What's going on?</p>
    <p>If the video is brand new, its likely Youtube has not transcribed the video yet.
      If there are transcripts on the video and Hieroglyph does not work, then that's a problem.
      Please let us know!</p>
